HTML &amp; Bootstrap student registration form

ðŸ’¡ **Tips:**  
- You can add a screenshot of your form in the repo and update the `![Form Preview](screenshot.png)` link.  
- Replace `yourusername` in the clone URL with your GitHub username.  

If you want, I can **also make a fancier README** with **live demo link and badges**, which looks very professional for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
